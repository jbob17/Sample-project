    <h1> What is this?</h1>
    <p> Oh danggg, you made it! Hey baby, this is the project I've been working
        on for some weeks now (you probably thought it was the poster lol). It's basically a website made from scratch, 
        mainly featuring a gallery of our year together. Since I'm not as artistic as you or have the best handwriting, 
        I thought why not do this instead of a notebook. Last year I couldn't do anything because I didn't have time, but this year I have way too much time. 
        This is made from a lot of lines of code and will be fully interactive. This is used as a prototype and as a learning opportunity
        for future websites I make in the future, so once everythings put together, I'll give u the password that takes you to the gallery muahahahaha. 

        Thanks for reading bubba! Now gimme a kith.
